Start the work from leftover of 20250513.
Now, this new code saved as 1.0.1, which I am going to test on the server. 

Changed the dockerfile to repack image. 

on the ubuntu server:
```
docker build -t webrtc-server-demo .


```

This version of code is saved as 1.0.2
Since WebRTC has a lot of problems unsolved and not easy to debug. 

I plan to use another simpler method.
